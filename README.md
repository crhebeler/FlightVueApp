# FlightVueApp
Group Project 2 - FlightVUE 

Team Project consisted of Kathleen Souders, Abe Neto, Jose Araujo, and Christopher Hebeler
We created an app that used an API from Aviation Edge to return a search for all the live international flights. The app also provided users an itinerary to follow in order to arrive to the airport on time in relevance to their location and destination. FlightVUE also has a statistics page with various data about international air travel.
